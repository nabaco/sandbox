# NaBaCo's Sandbox

This repo is intended for different pet and test projects that I develop in my endless attempt to gain more knowledge and experince.
The code here might not be the most polished, even though I try to bring it up to a good level. The main intention is to play with new concepts and ideas, and not to bring production ready applications.

To compile, just enter any of the project directories and run `make`.

As this is a learning experience, feel free to leave comments in form of an issue/PR :)
